# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# owner = Owner.create(name: "Joseth", email:  "jpompomv2429@gmail.com", age:  18)
# animal = Animal.create(age: 2, color: "black and white" ,weight: "2k", species: "cat")
pet = Pet.create(name: "Poppy", animal_id: 1, owner_id: 1)
